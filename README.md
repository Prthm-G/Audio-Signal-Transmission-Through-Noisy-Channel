# Audio-Signal-Transmission-Through-Noisy-Channel

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a noise filtering system on an FPGA, aiming to transmit an audio signal through a noisy channel and recover it with minimal Bit Error Rate (BER). 

## Features
- Good and bad communication channels.
- Gilbert channel state machine for output analysis.
- SNR values of 21 dB and 9 dB for system performance evaluation.

## Requirements
- Audio Bandwidth: 20 KHz
- Target BER: \(10^{-3}\)
- Spectral Mask: 200 kHz
- Channel: Beta channel for the target
- Delay: As specified in the project details

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the documentation to get started.

## Usage
Run the provided simulation models to evaluate the systemâ€™s performance under different noise conditions.
